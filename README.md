# Portfolio Website 

This is my portfolio Website - check it here -> [nbtb.eu](https://nbtb.eu).
This is already second version, just check commits to see code of the other one!
I didn't knew that there is something like CSS Snap when I was building first version so i build my own Snap in JavaScript... and JQuery.
Second version is clean CSS website. JavaScript is only for Google Analitycs and Recaptcha. It's simple but has some nice animations, clean CSS popup window etc.

## It uses

- HTML
- Node.js
- SASS 

## Some npm packages

- express 
- axios 
- [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/)
