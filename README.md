# mainWebsite

This is my portfolio webpage - check it here -> [nbtb.eu](https://nbtb.eu).
This is already second version, just check commits to see code on the other one!
I didn't knew that there is something like CSS Snap when I was building first version so i build my own Snap in JavaScript... and JQuery maybe.
Second version is clean CSS website. JavaScript is only for Google Analitycs and Recaptcha. It's simple but it has some nice animations, clean CSS popup window etc.

## It uses

- HTML
- Node.js
- SASS 
- jQuery

## Some npm packages

- express 
- axios 
- [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/)
